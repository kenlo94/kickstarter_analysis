    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">For the first analysis, tasks included creating new

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">A challenge I ran into was learning how to use the
        new COUNTIFS() function. This was the first time I had used this function and I was unsure what arguments to
        input into the function. It became easier to understand once I researched how this function operated. However, I
        was still making errors on my notation so I kept having to go back to edit my arguments.</p>

            id="What_are_two_conclusions_you_can_draw_about_the_Outcomes_based_on_Launch_Date_28"></a>What are two
        conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?</h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31"><img src="Images/Outcome_vs_Launch2.png"
            alt="Screenshot"></p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">If a campaign is launched in the Summer months
        (May, June, July) then they are more likely to succeed since the count of successful campaigns is higher during
        that time period. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that canceled campaigns are low and steady all year
        round at or below 7 counts.</p>
    <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=34 data-line-end=35><a
            id="What_can_you_conclude_about_the_Outcomes_based_on_Goals_34"></a>What can you conclude about the Outcomes
        based on Goals?</h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37"><img src="Images/Outcome_vs_Goals2.png"
            alt="Screenshot"></p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">Generally speaking, the lower the goal amount, the
        higher the success rate. Although there are some instances where campaigns are just as successful, such as in
        the 35k to 45k range. Also, none of these campaigns were canceled, which was quite surprising to see.</p>

            id="What_are_some_limitations_of_this_dataset_40"></a>What are some limitations of this dataset?</h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">This dataset is small with only 4,115 rows, so
        there is not much information. This dataset mainly tells the viewer if a campaign was successful, if they
        failed, or if they were canceled. However, I believe the data served its purpose regarding both analyses.</p>

        possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?</h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">We could create graphs using different filters for
        the parent category and subcategory instead of looking at just “Theatre” for the parent Category and “plays” for
        the subcategory. We could also take a look at the percentage funded and the average donation to see if they have
        any impact on the outcome of a campaign (successful, failed, canceled).</p>
